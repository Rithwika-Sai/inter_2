Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing Black Friday sales data to understand customer purchasing behavior and identify key factors that influence spending during large-scale retail events. The dataset contains demographic information, product details, and purchase amounts, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

 Dataset Description:
The dataset includes transactional data collected during Black Friday sales with the following key features:
User_ID – Unique identifier for customers
Product_ID – Unique identifier for products
Gender – Customer gender
Age – Age group of the customer
Occupation – Occupation code of the customer
City_Category – City type (A, B, or C)
Stay_In_Current_City_Years – Number of years stayed in the current city
Marital_Status – Marital status of the customer
Product_Category_1, 2, 3 – Product category codes
Purchase – Total purchase amount (target variable)

 Objectives:
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns
Analyze the impact of demographics on purchase behavior
Handle missing values and perform data preprocessing
Apply feature engineering techniques
Build machine learning models to predict purchase amounts
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Tools & Technologies:
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning models
